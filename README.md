# Ball Collision Handling in 2D

This project is a simulation of ball collision handling in a 2D environment using HTML canvas and JavaScript. It provides a visual representation of how balls interact and collide with each other while respecting physics principles such as conservation of momentum and energy.

## Use Case

### When is it useful?

The simulation can be useful in various scenarios including:

- **Game Development**: Understand and implement collision detection and response mechanisms for 2D games involving bouncing objects or projectiles.

- **Physics Education**: Visualize and experiment with basic physics principles such as momentum, energy conservation, and elastic collisions.

- **Engineering Simulations**: Model interactions between objects in engineering simulations, such as particle dynamics or mechanical systems.

- **Robotics**: Simulate collisions between objects in robotics scenarios, aiding in path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms.

- **Graphics and Animation**: Explore collision detection algorithms for computer graphics and animation applications, improving realism and interactivity.
